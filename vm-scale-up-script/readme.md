## VM Resizing Demo

These sample scripts will scale up (upgrade-vm.ps1) & scale down (downgrade-vm.ps1) a VM and its disks. This script assumes that the VM has a single data disk attached.

Update the variables in the scripts to match your environment and then run the script from an Azure Cloud Shell session.
